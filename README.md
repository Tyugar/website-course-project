# website-course-project

This is my simple website project developed together with my Fellow xxx for Internet Technologies course during our third year of study on
faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science on Silesian University of Technology. 

Our project is a whisky rating website. Visitors can register an account and then find informations about many different whiskys and of course review them .These reviews are visible for other users who can upvote them if they agree. Website allows users to browse whisky in many different categories and rankings and also to search particular whisky by its name. 

To develop such a website technology stack consisted Java with Spring, Thymeleaf, H2 DataBase, jQuery, Bootstrap. My person is responsible for all backand stuff including thymeleaf implementation into HTML templates and some minor part of frontend including Ajax communication between client and server. 

I'm aware about lack of many important things in this project like f.e. server side validation, but im still trying to extend it sometimes
